# Managing Model Data for SwiftUI with the new Observation Feature 

## Configure the sample code project

To run the sample app:

1. Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities tab of the target
settings.
2. If your Mac is running macOS 14 or later, select My Mac as the destination; 
otherwise, select an iOS device or simulator running iOS 17 or later.
3. Build and run the app.

## Observation vs ObservableObject


this project is originaly from the WWDC 2023
[Managing model data in your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/managing-model-data-in-your-app).

I modified it to show the difference to the older data flow with ObservableObject. Check out this Youtube video where I discuss this in more detail: https://youtu.be/xcKT_wgq_EQ
